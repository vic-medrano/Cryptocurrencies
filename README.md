# Cryptocurrencies
The purpose of this project was to use unsupervised learning methods to create an analysis on cryptocurrency. The data was preprocessed to fit unsupervised machine learning given that there was no known output. Once the data was processed, a clustering algorithm was used and 2-D and 3-D visualizations were created to display the findings.
